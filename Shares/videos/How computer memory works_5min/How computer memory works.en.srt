1
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,030
In many ways, 
our memories make us who we are,

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,059
helping us remember our past,

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,988
learn and retain skills,

4
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:16,273
and plan for the future.

5
00:00:16,273 --> 00:00:19,916
And for the computers that often act
as extensions of ourselves,

6
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,126
memory plays much the same role,

7
00:00:22,126 --> 00:00:23,711
whether it's a two-hour movie,

8
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:25,282
a two-word text file,

9
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:27,833
or the instructions for opening either,

10
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:33,372
everything in a computer's memory
takes the form of basic units called bits,

11
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:35,846
or binary digits.

12
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:38,386
Each of these is stored in a memory cell

13
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:42,185
that can switch between two states
for two possible values,

14
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:44,057
0 and 1.

15
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:47,177
Files and programs consist of millions
of these bits,

16
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:50,428
all processed in 
the central processing unit,

17
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:51,745
or CPU,

18
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:54,096
that acts as the computer's brain.

19
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:58,671
And as the number of bits needing
to be processed grows exponentially,

20
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:01,532
computer designers face 
a constant struggle

21
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:05,295
between size, cost, and speed.

22
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:10,126
Like us, computers have short-term memory
for immediate tasks,

23
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:13,407
and long-term memory 
for more permanent storage.

24
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,277
When you run a program,

25
00:01:15,277 --> 00:01:18,950
your operating system allocates area
within the short-term memory

26
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,845
for performing those instructions.

27
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:24,392
For example, when you press a key
in a word processor,

28
00:01:24,392 --> 00:01:29,536
the CPU will access one of these locations
to retrieve bits of data.

29
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:33,861
It could also modify them,
or create new ones.

30
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:38,258
The time this takes is known 
as the memory's latency.

31
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:43,801
And because program instructions must be
processed quickly and continuously,

32
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:48,563
all locations within the short-term memory
can be accessed in any order,

33
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:51,714
hence the name random access memory.

34
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:55,900
The most common type of RAM 
is dynamic RAM, or DRAM.

35
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,989
There, each memory cell consists
of a tiny transistor and a capacitor

36
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,987
that store electrical charges,

37
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:07,554
a 0 when there's no charge,
or a 1 when charged.

38
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:09,167
Such memory is called dynamic

39
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:13,380
because it only holds charges briefly
before they leak away,

40
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,759
requiring periodic recharging
to retain data.

41
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,005
But even its low latency 
of 100 nanoseconds

42
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,651
is too long for modern CPUs,

43
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:26,563
so there's also a small, 
high-speed internal memory cache

44
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,512
made from static RAM.

45
00:02:28,513 --> 00:02:31,722
That's usually made up 
of six interlocked transistors

46
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:33,624
which don't need refreshing.

47
00:02:33,624 --> 00:02:36,779
SRAM is the fastest memory 
in a computer system,

48
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:38,680
but also the most expensive,

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,414
and takes up three times 
more space than DRAM.

50
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:46,596
But RAM and cache can only hold data
as long as they're powered.

51
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:49,625
For data to remain
once the device is turned off,

52
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:53,005
it must be transferred 
into a long-term storage device,

53
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:55,291
which comes in three major types.

54
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,739
In magnetic storage, 
which is the cheapest,

55
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:03,560
data is stored as a magnetic pattern on
a spinning disc coated with magnetic film.

56
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,203
But because the disc must rotate 
to where the data is located

57
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:08,621
in order to be read,

58
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:14,510
the latency for such drives is 100,000 
times slower than that of DRAM.

59
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,625
On the other hand, optical-based storage
like DVD and Blu-ray

60
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:20,621
also uses spinning discs,

61
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,813
but with a reflective coating.

62
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:28,029
Bits are encoded as light and dark spots
using a dye that can be read by a laser.

63
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:31,151
While optical storage media are cheap
and removable,

64
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:34,878
they have even slower latencies 
than magnetic storage

65
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,236
and lower capacity as well.

66
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:42,870
Finally, the newest and fastest types of
long-term storage are solid-state drives,

67
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:44,025
like flash sticks.

68
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,957
These have no moving parts,

69
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,626
instead using floating gate transistors

70
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:53,134
that store bits by trapping 
or removing electrical charges

71
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:56,452
within their specially designed 
internal structures.

72
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,739
So how reliable 
are these billions of bits?

73
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,463
We tend to think of computer memory
as stable and permanent,

74
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:06,363
but it actually degrades fairly quickly.

75
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:09,000
The heat generated from a device
and its environment

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,739
will eventually demagnetize hard drives,

77
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:13,991
degrade the dye in optical media,

78
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:17,115
and cause charge leakage 
in floating gates.

79
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:20,081
Solid-state drives 
also have an additional weakness.

80
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:24,095
Repeatedly writing to floating gate 
transistors corrodes them,

81
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:26,705
eventually rendering them useless.

82
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:29,215
With data on most current storage media

83
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:31,957
having less than 
a ten-year life expectancy,

84
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:36,333
scientists are working to exploit
the physical properties of materials

85
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,649
down to the quantum level

86
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,998
in the hopes of making 
memory devices faster,

87
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:42,063
smaller,

88
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:43,609
and more durable.

89
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:49,044
For now, immortality remains out of reach,
for humans and computers alike.
